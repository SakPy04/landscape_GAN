This project was a learning endeavor to explore Generative AI through deep learning. Using a Kaggle dataset, I trained a generator and a discriminator as part of a Generative Adversarial Network. After using Google Cloud Computing on a GPU, I trained the model for approximately nine hours generating over 6000+ images. This model was eventually saved as a pkl file.  

As part of the learning experience, I learned a lot about deep learning and training a DQGAN on an image dataset. In the future, I hope to generate higher-resolution images. 

Here is a sample of a few images generated by this model:
